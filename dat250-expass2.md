## Short summary
In this assignment i have implemented a simple REST API for Poll app using Spring Boot. I decided to use a Model View Controller 
structure for this project which i think turned out good. Controller folder contains the controllers for Poll, User and Vote. In the model we implement the logic for the Poll,
User, Vote and VoteOption. We have a repository folder which contains the PollManager.

I have manager to follow and finish the following steps in this assignemnt:
- Step 1 - I created a Spring project and initialized it to GitHub.
- Step 2 - I implemented the classes with the given parameters set in the task description.
- Step 3 - I implemented test scenarios, and did this by using Bruno.
- Step 4 - I implemented the controllers using @RestController and the corresponding @...Mappings.
- Step 6 - I added the given dependencies to the gradle file and tinkered around and saw if there were improvements to be made.

- Working with new idea Intellij so spent some time to get familiar with the idea
- Spent some time getting git repository to work with idea

## Pending issues
- Step 5, not created automated testing
